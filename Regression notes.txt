Ordinary least squares estimates the beta coefficients in a linear regression model by minimizing a measure of error called the sum of squared residuals. 
The large E shaped symbol is the capital Greek letter, sigma, and it denotes a sum. So the sum of squared residuals is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression model. E (yi- yihat)
