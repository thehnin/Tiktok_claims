# Multiple Linear Regression
## Linearity 
Each predictor variable X_i is linearly related to the outcome variable Y. Plotting scatter plots of each X variable against the y-variable one form us which variables likely have a linear relationship with Y.

## Independent Observations
each observation in the dataset is independent. We can only examine this assumption by checking the data collection process.
