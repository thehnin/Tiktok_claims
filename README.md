# Multiple Linear Regression
## Linearity 
Each predictor variable X_i is linearly related to the outcome variable Y. Plotting scatter plots of each X variable against the y-variable one form us which variables likely have a linear relationship with Y.

## Independent Observations
each observation in the dataset is independent. We can only examine this assumption by checking the data collection process. 

## Normality 
The residuals are normally distributed

## Homoscedasticity
The variation of the residuals errors is constant or similar across the model.

## No multicollinearity 
No two independent variables, X_i and X_j can be highly correlated with each other. This means that X_i and X_j cannot be linearly related to each other.

> [!NOTE]
> Residuals are the difference between the predicted and observed values. You can calculate residuals after you build a regression model by subtracting the predicted values from the observed values.
> Errors are the natural noise assumed to be in the model.
